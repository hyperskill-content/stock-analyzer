# The Stock Analyzer

## **Introduction**
With this project, you will utilize the OpenAI API to develop a specialized assistant for analyzing and visualizing stock market data, use the OpenAI client to implement knowledge retrieval, code interpretation, and function calling functionalities within the assistant, and implement prompt engineering strategies to direct the assistant in processing stock data and creating visual plots.

## **Tasks**

This project is divided into various tasks that you need to complete. The tasks are located in the tasks folder of the repository. Each task includes all the necessary objectives, suggested development steps, expected outcomes, and useful resources.

## **Useful Resources**

Each task will contain a collection of resources that will be helpful for you as you solve the task. There are links to topics in Hyperskill, documentation, and other helpful tutorials that you and your team can use. You may not always need to use all the provided resources if you're already familiar with the concepts. In addition to the provided resources, you can always discuss with your teammates and experts.

## **The flow**
Fork → Clone → Branch → Implement → PR → Review

* Fork this repo to your own GitHub account
* Create a new branch for each task (e.g., task-1) if applicable (if there is any code that has to be implemented)
